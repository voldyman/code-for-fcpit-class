#Simple Programs for FCPIT Class
*(FCPIT == Fundamental of Computer Programming and Information Technology)*

These programs are supposed to written in C++ (Turbo C++) but due to its compatibility issues with [Linux (elementary OS)](http://elementaryos.org) so i am using [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala).

###Installing Vala
For debian / Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install valac

###Compiling Programs
The command for compiling all programs is almost the same (some might have specific commands in the comment)

    valac <program_name>.vala
    //example
    valac stars-rec.vala

###Extra
Anyone is free to copy these programs (try to give me some credit :) )
