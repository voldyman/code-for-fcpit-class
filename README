#Simple Programs for FCPIT Class
*(FCPIT == Fundamental of Computer Programming and Information Technology)*

These programs are supposed to written in C++ (Turbo C++) but due to its compatibility issues with [Linux (elementary OS)](http://elementaryos.org) so i am using [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala).

Anyone is free to copy these programs (try to give me some credit :) )
